== Welcome to Inotegration

Inotegration was made by Inovare (http://www.inovare.net) to help Rails programmers and companies to do easy Continuous Integration with RubyOnRails.

Inotegration runs any tests, specs and metrics inside your project.

== Getting Started

To use Inotegration, you have to follow these three steps:

1. Create simlinks inside the "projects" folder to each of your projects.
2. Run "rake projects:schedule_analyses" once to update your crontab and schedule periodical analyses
3. There's no third step! You're ready to use Inotegration!

== Information

Inotegration was created by Felipe Giotto (felipegiotto@gmail.com) from Inovare (http://www.inovare.net) and was inspired by Marty Andrews (http://blog.martyandrews.net), more specifically by one of his posts, "Enforcing Ruby code quality" (http://blog.martyandrews.net/2009/05/enforcing-ruby-code-quality.html).

Inotegration checks for modification in GIT and SVN repositories, periodically running "svn update" or "git pull" commands. If any changes are fetch from the repository, Inotegration starts the above tasks, storing the results in the database.

These tasks are performed by Inotegration to each of your projects:

1. Unit and Funcional tests (Test::Unit)
2. Specs (not ready yet)
3. Flog Code Complexity Analysis (see http://ruby.sadi.st/Flog.html for more information)
4. Flay Code Duplication Analysis (see http://ruby.sadi.st/Flay.html for more information)
5. Roodi Code Quality Analysis (see http://roodi.rubyforge.org for more information)
6. Reek Code Quality Analysis (see http://wiki.github.com/kevinrutherford/reek for more information)
7. Finally, "rake stats"
