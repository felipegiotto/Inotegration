== Welcome to Inotegration

Inotegration was made by Inovare (http://www.inovare.net) to help Rails 
programmers and companies to do easy Asynchronous Continuous Integration 
with RubyOnRails, without needing to edit giant XML files.

Inotegration runs any tests, specs and metrics inside your project.

PLEASE! Feel free to send suggestions, patches, complains, bugs, anything related 
to Inotegration to me (felipegiotto a gmail.com), I'll answer as soon as
possible!

== Getting Started

To use Inotegration, you have to follow these steps:

1. Install any missing gems with "sudo rake gems:install"
2. Create simlinks inside the "projects" folder to each of your projects.
3. Run "rake projects:schedule_analyses" once to update your crontab and 
schedule periodical analyses
4. There's no fourth step! You're ready to use Inotegration! Migrate your production 
database, start the server and try!

You need to use the production environment, because the "whenever" gem schedules 
the updates in the production database. If you need to change this behavior, type
"crontab -e" manually and change the RAILS_ENV manually.

== Information

Inotegration was created by Felipe Giotto (felipegiotto a gmail.com) from 
Inovare (http://www.inovare.net) and was inspired by Marty Andrews 
(http://blog.martyandrews.net), more specifically by one of his posts, 
"Enforcing Ruby code quality" (http://blog.martyandrews.net/2009/05/enforcing-ruby-code-quality.html).

Inotegration checks for modification in GIT and SVN repositories, periodically 
running "svn update" or "git pull" commands. If any changes are fetched from the 
repository, Inotegration starts the above tasks, storing the results in the database.

These tasks are performed by Inotegration to each of your projects:

1. Unit and Funcional tests (Test::Unit)
2. Specs
3. Flog Code Complexity Analysis (see http://ruby.sadi.st/Flog.html for more information)
4. Flay Code Duplication Analysis (see http://ruby.sadi.st/Flay.html for more information)
5. Roodi Code Quality Analysis (see http://roodi.rubyforge.org for more information)
6. Reek Code Quality Analysis (see http://wiki.github.com/kevinrutherford/reek for 
more information)
7. Finally, "rake stats"

Inotegration was built with Ubuntu 9.X, but it should work with most operational systems.
With Windows (blearghhh!), you may need to manually schedule the "rake projects:analyse"
to run periodically, since Inotegration uses cron to schedule tasks.

== Customization

You may customize Flog, Flay, Roodi and Reek by editing "config/inotegration.yml" 
(created automatically).

The MaximumFlogComplexity key stores the complexity threshold from Flog. 
You can change this threshold to any value you want.
We recommend reading the Flog README file for more information.

The MaximumFlayThreshold key stores the duplication threshold from Flay.
You can change this threshold to any value you want.
We recommend reading the Flay README file for more information.

The RoodiConfig key stores many keys and values to customize Roodi.
We recommend reading the Roodi README file for more information.

The ReekConfig key stores many keys and values to customize Reek
We recommend reading the Reek README file for more information.

== Excuses

I'm a big fan of TDD and BDD. But, this is my story: I'm at my family's house,
in a Valentine's Day, without my girlfriend. So, I decided to use these "free" days 
to make some experiments. Then, suddenly, Inotegration was born!

Now, it's sunday afternoon, soon I'll go home and I want to publish my code as
soon as possible. So, I'll put this code on Github and then, when I have some free time,
according to the good TDD practices, I'll delete each piece of my code, 
make some tests and develop Inotegration again from scratch. These modifications
will soon be available in Github
